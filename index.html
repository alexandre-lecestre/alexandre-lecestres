	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p> I started my PhD in September 2019 at the University of Luxembourg under the supervision of Prof. Yannick Baraud.
		My work is essentially related to robust estimation, non i.i.d. settings, mixture models, hidden Markov models, empirical processes ...
		I'm currently looking for a postdoc.</p>
